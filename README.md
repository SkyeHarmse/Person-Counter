# Person-Counter
a 'counting app' built with HTML, CSS &amp; JAVASCRIPT
My idea came from seeing a security gaurd ticking off the amount of people entering and exiting the store.
He was using a piece of paper to log the amount of people that entered the store. and as you know technology can do the job better.
My solution to this was ot build an app that logs the amount of people that entered the store for the day.
